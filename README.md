## Hi there 👋

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Siqi Xiang** — an aspiring **Applied Data Scientist** with a strong interest in building data-driven decision systems for real-world business problems.

I focus on turning messy data into actionable insights, designing end-to-end pipelines, and evaluating decisions under real constraints (capacity, cost, uncertainty), rather than training models in isolation.

- 🎓 Currently pursuing a Master’s in **AI for Health** at Stockholm University
- 💼 Previously worked as a **Strategy Analyst at TikTok (ByteDance)**, focusing on business models, platform ecosystems, and growth strategy
- 🔍 Particularly interested in **business-oriented data science**, decision modeling, and applied machine learning
- 📊 Comfortable bridging **business thinking + data science** — from problem framing to execution-ready outputs
- 💬 Happy to talk about **Python, SQL, churn modeling, decision metrics (precision@K, lift, EV), and analytics**
- 📫 Reach me via GitHub or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siqi-xiang/)
- 🎯 Fun fact: `print()` is still my most reliable debugging tool

## ⭐ Featured Project

### **Customer Retention Targeting & Decision System**
*Python · AWS S3 · pandas · scikit-learn*

An end-to-end, business-driven data science project that simulates how real companies design, evaluate, and execute retention campaigns under resource constraints.

- Built a full pipeline from **raw transactional data** to **campaign-ready ranked customer lists**
- Engineered time-based customer features (recency, frequency, monetary value) and churn labels using realistic lookback and prediction windows
- Designed churn risk scoring and evaluated decisions using **precision@K** and **lift**
- Implemented an **Expected Value (EV)** framework combining churn risk, customer value, incentive cost, and uplift assumptions
- Produced final business artifacts including **EV-ranked customer lists**, **run summaries**, and **operator documentation** for marketing execution
- Structured data and batch scoring pipelines on **AWS S3**, separating raw, processed, feature, score, and artifact layers

## 🔭 What I’m Working Toward

Building more **business-facing data science systems**, especially in areas like:
- customer lifecycle & retention
- resource allocation under constraints
- decision-focused ML (when models help — and when they don’t)

If you’re interested in applied data science beyond just model training, feel free to reach out.
