**👋 Hi there**~

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Siqi Xiang**, an aspiring **Applied Data Scientist** with a strong interest in building data-driven decision systems for real-world business problems.

I focus on turning messy data into actionable insights, designing end-to-end pipelines, and evaluating decisions under real constraints (capacity, cost, uncertainty), rather than training models in isolation.

- 🎓 Currently pursuing a Master’s in **AI for Health** at Stockholm University
- 💼 Previously worked as a **Strategy Analyst at TikTok (ByteDance)**, focusing on business models, platform ecosystems, and growth strategy
- 🔍 Particularly interested in **business-oriented data science**, decision modeling, and applied machine learning
- 📊 Comfortable bridging **business thinking + data science** — from problem framing to execution-ready outputs
- 💬 Happy to talk about **Python, SQL, churn modeling, decision metrics (precision@K, lift, EV), and analytics**
- 📫 Reach me via GitHub or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siqi-xiang/)
- 🎯 Fun fact: `print()` is still my most reliable debugging tool

## ⭐ Featured Projects

[Budget-Constrained Monetization Allocation & Decision System](https://github.com/SiqiHsiang/game-monetization-allocation)

*Python* • *PostgreSQL* • *Docker* • *Data Visualization*

A decision-focused system for allocating a fixed promotional budget to **maximize short-term incremental revenue**.
- Framed monetization as a budget-constrained optimization problem at the *user × offer* level
- Designed an **EV-based scoring framework** combining **historical spend**, **segment-level uplift**, and **per-user cost**
- Implemented **global ranking and allocation** to produce executable campaign lists
- Delivered **operator-ready artifacts** (allocation CSVs, EV curves, segment breakdowns) emphasizing interpretability

[Customer Retention Targeting & Decision System](https://github.com/SiqiHsiang/online-retail-churn)

*Python* • *AWS S3* • *pandas* • *scikit-learn*

An end-to-end retention decision system for selecting customers under operational constraints.
- Built a pipeline from **transactional data to ranked customer lists**
- Engineered time-based behavioral features and churn labels
- Evaluated targeting strategies with **precision@K, lift, and Expected Value (EV)**
- Produced campaign-ready artifacts for marketing execution

## 🔭 What I’m Working Toward

Building more **business-facing data science systems**, focusing on:
- data-driven decision-making under uncertainty, using models selectively and responsibly
- prioritization and optimization of resources under real-world constraints
- decision-focused ML (when models help and when they don’t)

If you’re interested in applied data science beyond just model training, feel free to reach out.
