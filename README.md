## Hi there 👋

## 😊 About Me:

Hi, I’m **Siqi Xiang**. I’m studying AI for Health and really into machine learning. I enjoy training models, exploring data, and solving real-world problems with ML. I’m always excited to learn new technologies and collaborate on exciting projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently exploring **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on more **hands-on Data Science experiments**, cool **side projects**, and anything that helps me learn by building.
- 💼 Previously worked as a **Strategy Analyst** at TikTok, where I focused on analyzing **business models, platform ecosystems, and strategic insights** for product and market growth.
- 📊 Skilled at combining **data-driven methods with business analysis** — I enjoy breaking down complex systems and understanding how technology shapes industries. 
- 💬 Talk to me if you’re into: **Python**, **SQL**, **Data Visualization**, **scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **Analytical Thinking**.
- 📫 How to reach me: via Github or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siqi-xiang/) message.
- 🎯 Fun fact: I treat print() as my personal therapist.
